# Checklists & Documentation
## Developer
### GitHub Tickets & Pull Requests
**Once the developer choses a ticket to resolve:**
1. Name your code branch to match the ticket.
For example, an issue titled `Flux Capacitor Bug #180` would have a branch named `180-Flux-Capacitor-Bug`.
2. Create the pull request that corresponds with an issue. (Do not add an approver yet)
3. Work on the code
4. When your pull request is ready to be reviewed, add an approver (letting the team know we're dealing with merge ready code).
*Reviewer will be alerted to the required task via email.*

**Once the pull request is reviewed, the Reviewer:**
1. Selects the "Approve" option from the pull request dialog
2. Adds the "ready to merge" tag to the Pulle Request
*Reviewer can also add comments and requests changes before approving pull request*

**Once pull request is approved, the Developer:**
1. Merges the code into master
2. Tells the lead to push the code into production

# Checklists & Documentation
## Developer
### GitHub Tickets & Pull Requests
#### Once the developer choses a ticket to resolve:
1. Name your code branch to match the ticket.
    * For example, an issue titled `Flux Capacitor Bug #180` would have a branch named `180-Flux-Capacitor-Bug`.
2. Create the pull request that corresponds with an issue.
    * Do not add an approver yet, but add any project tags needed.
    * If using command line: After making the branch you have to push it to origin <branch-name> before making the pull request.
3. Work on the code :sparkles:

#### When Code is ready to review, the Developer:
1. Push changes to your branch
2. Add a reviewer to the pull request
    * This lets the team know we're dealing with merge-ready code.
    * Reviewer will be alerted to the required task via email.

#### Once the pull request is reviewed, the Reviewer:
1. Selects the "Approve" option from the pull request dialog
2. Adds the "ready to merge" tag to the pull request
    * Reviewer can also add comments and requests changes before approving pull request

#### Once pull request is approved, the Developer:
1. Merges the code into master
2. Tells the lead to push the code into production

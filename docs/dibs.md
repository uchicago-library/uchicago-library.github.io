# What is DIBS?

DIBS is an open-source [controlled digital
lending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_digital_lending) web
application.  The project originates from
[Caltech](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dibs/).

## Background

A number of open-source controlled digital lending applications sprung
up during the 2020 pandemic, due to a need for continuing to have
course reserve materials available when university libraries were in
general not open for use by patrons.

In the fall of 2020, we looked into several different possibilities
and ended up using
[G-CDL](https://github.com/Fordham-University-Libraries/G-CDL), a PHP
and Angular-based application that uses Google Drive to manage access
to copyrighted materials.  As of 2022, however, we are looking to
switch to DIBS, in large part due to the fact that the lead developer
of G-CDL is no longer actively developing the project.  The tech stack
used by DIBS is also much closer to what we use at UChicago.

## Timeline

As of October 2022, we are hoping to deploy DIBS for testing in
December in time to begin using it for electronic course reserves by
the beginning of the Winter 2023 quarter.  Installation and setup are
fairly complex, so this document is an attempt to get the process down
in writing, so that we don't have to figure it all out again the next
time we install it.

# ADA Compliance
* The Library strives for [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#requirements-for-wcag-2-1) Compliance
* WCAG standards mostly apply to web and video media, but print has to maintain color contrast and cognitive readability.
* AA is the acceptable level of accessibility for both online and print. For print is provides good enough contrast for most visual needs. For online this level works with most assistive technology which is now widely available.
* AAA compliance is viewed as the gold standard level of accessibility, which provides everything for a complete accessible offering, including all the bells and whistles which make the difference between a very good experience and an excellent one.

* The UChicago color palette is not all ADA compliant. Please use a contrast checker to verify if your foreground/background colors meet AA standards.

## Resources
* WebAIM [Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
* Event promotion must include ADA fine print verbiage:

"Persons with disabilities who need an accommodation in order to participate in this
event should contact _[event organizer]_ at _[event organizer's phone]_ for assistance."

## Fonts
### Print
* **8.5" x 11":** It is recommended not to go below 14pt font for main text or 10pt font for fine print information
* **Stanchion signs:** It is recommended not to go below 20pt font for main text or 14pt font for fine print information
* **Banners:** 104pt fonts is the most readable from across a room for headlines. It is recommended that font size does not go below 30pt.

### Web
* It is suggested to use `rem` or `em` units rather than `px` as both rem and em are scalable. This allows users to easily embiggen browser font sizing for readability.

# ADA Compliance
* The Library strives for [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#requirements-for-wcag-2-1) Compliance
* Try not to rely on just color to show differences, but also include icons, patterns, or text to aid in your message.
* The UChicago color palette is not all ADA compliant. Please use a contrast checker to verify if your foreground/background colors meet AA standards.
* Use WebAIM [Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to check color contrast of text.
* If using many adjesent colors (aka: graphs), use the [Coblis Color Blindness simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/)

## Print
* Print on non-glossy; white, ivory, or cream paper
* Use lists or bullets when possible / avoid long paragraphs on posters and promotional materials
* Use clear and simple language, avoiding jargon and technical terms
* Organize content under headings and subheadings
* Event promotion must include ADA fine print verbiage:

"Persons with disabilities who need an accommodation in order to participate in this
event should contact _[event organizer]_ at _[event organizer's phone]_ for assistance."

### Fonts
* **8.5" x 11"** Minimum of: 20pt for headlines; 14pt font for main text; 10pt font for fine print information
* **Stanchion signs:** Minimum of: 24pt for headlines;  20pt font for main text; 14pt font for fine print information
* **Banners:** 130pt fonts is the most readable from across a room for headlines. It is recommended that font size does not go below 30pt.

## Web
* It is suggested to use `rem` or `em` units rather than `px` as both rem and em are scalable. This allows users to easily embiggen browser font sizing for readability. (_[Rem versus em](https://j.eremy.net/confused-about-rem-and-em/) Article_)
* View [web checklist](web-checklist.md) or [code snippets](code-resources.md) for more info

## Additional Info
* WCAG standards mostly apply to web and video media, but print has to maintain color contrast and cognitive readability.
* AA is the acceptable level of accessibility for both online and print. For print is provides good enough contrast for most visual needs. For online this level works with most assistive technology which is now widely available.
* AAA compliance is viewed as the gold standard level of accessibility, which provides everything for a complete accessible offering, including all the bells and whistles which make the difference between a very good experience and an excellent one.

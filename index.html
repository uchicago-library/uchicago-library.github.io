        <h1>Digital Library Development Center</h1>
        <p>The Digital Library Development Center (DLDC) collaborates with library staff, university faculty, departments and other groups on campus, and colleagues at other institutions, to enable discovery of the library's information resources, to make the campus community aware of the library's services, to build digital collections, and to ensure the persistence and usability of the library's digital resources over time.</p>

        <p>Core activities include designing, building, and maintaining web sites, databases, <a href="http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/h/dl">digital collections</a>, and the Library Digital Repository; installing and supporting both commercial and open-source systems that provide access to information resources, e.g., the <a href="http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/category/SFXOverview">SFX</a> link server, the <a href="http://luna.lib.uchicago.edu/">Luna Imaging</a> software environment for image collections, and the VuFind <a href="https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/">library catalog</a> software; administering the network of information server computers which underlie the digital library and support related initiatives on campus; researching, evaluating, and implementing new technologies; participating in national and international digital library initiatives; and documenting and sharing information about our work.</p>

        <h2>Visit Us</h2>
        <p>To visit the DLDC, once on the 2nd floor of the Regenstein Library, turn right, and walk past the bank of elevators and the glassed-in office on the right (Room 216) until you see the door to Room 220 directly ahead of you. The <a href="https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/spaces/joseph-regenstein-library/2nd-floor-reading-room/">2nd Floor Reading Room Floorplan</a> will help to guide you to our offices.
